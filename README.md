# Calculator Project

A functional on-screen calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

## ✨ Features
- Two-line display (history + current input)
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Clear button to reset calculator
- Full expression shown (e.g., `5 + 6 =`)
- Responsive grid-based layout

## 🧠 What I Learned
- DOM manipulation  
- Event listeners for multiple buttons  
- Managing state in JavaScript (`firstNumber`, `operator`, `secondNumber`)  
- Updating UI dynamically  
- Debugging common DOM/JS issues

## 🚧 Planned Improvements
- Backspace (⌫) button logic  
- Decimal (.) input support  
- Prevent multiple decimals  
- Better floating-point rounding  
- Error handling for divide-by-zero  
- Keyboard support  

## 📁 How to Run
Just open `index.html` in any browser.
